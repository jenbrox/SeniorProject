      "Concerts are my most favorite thing, and my boyfriend knew it. That's why, for our anniversary, he got me tickets to see my favorite artist. Not only that, but the tickets were for an outdoor show, which I love much more than being in a crowded stadium. Since he knew I was such a big fan of music, he got tickets for himself, and even a couple of my friends. He is so incredibly nice and considerate to me and what I like to do. I will always remember this event and I will always cherish him. On the day of the concert, I got ready, and he picked me up and we went out to a restaurant beforehand. He is so incredibly romantic. He knew exactly where to take me without asking. We ate, laughed, and had a wonderful dinner date before the big event. We arrived at the concert and the music was so incredibly beautiful. I loved every minute of it. My friends, boyfriend, and I all sat down next to each other. As the music was slowly dying down, I found us all getting lost just staring at the stars. It was such an incredibly unforgettable and beautiful night.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",
      "My roommate doesn't give the credit they deserves They really helped me out over Easter Sunday. I started to feel weary a little bit before that, but it got really bad on that day. I needed to be driven to the ER. I hated that I chose that day to get sick, but there's never going to be a good day to get sick, I suppose. My roommate was there from the time I was admitted to the time I got out of there. It was incredible. They showed incredible resolve and love for me. It was from an area of caring. There was no ulterior motive. If there was, wow did they hide it well. Imagine if this selflessness was commonplace in the world. This should happen more often. We should look out for our own more often. It doesn't happen enough. I plan on showing the same level of care if God forbid something happens to them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",
      "Today I had to bring my car to the mechanic.  I was involved in an accident and it was a single car.  I was so happy when they told me they would fix the car for free. I was surprised that today somebody would be willing to do that. I was going to tell everyone I knew about what a great company they were.  There are not many people in the world today who would be willing to do anything for free. It truly shows that there are still some amazing people out there. I love that they went above and beyond. My car now looks as good as new. I am very happy with everything. I am glad I had brought my car to them because someone else may not have done that. If I know anyone that is looking to get their car repaired I will refer them to this place. I was sad when the accident happened. I am just glad they were able to take care of everything for me. The work was done in a quick manner. All being said I met a great company that I would continue to use in the future. I will now pay it forward and help someone when they need something. This has restore my faith in humanity. Great people like them still exist in this world and I still have my car which I really love.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",
      "In July 2019, I made the decision to travel to a new state to meet friends from the internet that I had never met in person before. While I had met people from the internet in person in the past, this was the first time I was traveling overnight away from my home to do so. I would be visiting them in their home in Ohio. I was coming from Illinois, another internet friend was coming from New York, and we were meeting up with the 3rd friend in Ohio. I was nervous during the drive to Ohio. I had never been in the area before, and I didn't know anyone else in the area I could turn to in case things did not go as well as planned. Luckily, I was the first to arrive at the house, and I was finally able to meet my friend Tam in person. We were able to hang out and feel comfortable around one another like we had been friends for years (we had only spoken online for about 1 year). Soon, the 3rd person (Judy) arrived and we all had dinner together. There were a few awkward pauses, but for the post part, the trip went well and we all had a great time. We traveled around the Columbus area, went to a few different malls and went out for food and drinks. We all stayed in the same house and spent the evenings cooking together, watching movies and generally bonding and learning about each others lives and experiences. Overall, it was a very fun and memorable weekend. We are trying to plan another get together, but since we all live in different states and have busy lives, it is difficult to coordinate and time and place. I do hope that we can all get together again soon.                                                                     1\n",
      "That trip was so fun!  Not only did i get to meet new people that i was sure i would like, I got to see new places.  We talked so much online that we felt like we knew each other already, so it was really fun to meet up face to face and do things together.  I am sure we will stay in touch for a long time.  I sure hope we do.  One friend in particular and i really hit it off.  It was like we were long lost sisters or something and had finally reunited after many years.  We plan to get together again, without the entire group.  Im sue we will get together as a group again, but we two want to pursue our relationship further for sure. I think next time she will come see where i live.  Now that i got to see her stomping grounds so to speak, she can see mine.  She lives in a big city with lots and lots to do constantly.  I live in a much smaller city, but its right on the water so we will have quite a variety of different things to do.  She has never been kayaking, so that will definitely be on the to do list.  I sure am looking forward to our next get together!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",

      "It's been 5 months since I lost her but I still think about Granny Ma every day.  I remember when I was a child, Granny Ma would take me to the zoo.  I would sit in the back of the car and make animal noises during the entire drive.  Granny Ma would try to guess which animal I was but most of her guesses were always wrong.  When I told her which animal I was, she would tell me how smart I am.  I remember her long curly hair and how we would sit in front of the bathroom mirror as she would brush it out.  She would tell me how important it was to brush slowly in order to keep the hair healthy.  The thing I remembered the most was her smell.  Her home was a like a jasmine garden mixed with warm scents of vanilla and tea.  Everywhere she went left a trail of floral aroma.  It was such a pleasant, comforting smell.  I remember the last time I saw Granny Ma.  Five months ago I was sitting at the foot of the hospital bed.  Granny Ma was covered in tubes, monitors, and wires.  She would lay and smile at me with such soft eyes.  Her hand rested on mine as I would tell her stories of our trips to the zoo, how much I loved her homemade pies, and memories of listening to her play the flute.  I told her about our walks around the community park and how I would light up when I could smell her perfume.  Granny Ma told me how lucky she was to have me in her life and how happy she was to experience it all.  Granny Ma told me that she never had any regrets during her life and wouldn't change a thing.  That night Granny Ma went to sleep forever and the most amazing woman is now blessing Heaven with her heavenly scent.  I still miss her.    1\n",
      "On May 10, 2017 I graduated from a 4-year college. During those 4 years I made plenty of long-life friendships. My freshman year I was able to be a part of one of best Bands in the South. My Junior Year I got to join my favorite sorority. I got to make lifelong friendship and sisterhood from my sorority.  Goring up I struggled in Middle school all the way to Highschool and didnâ€™t think that I wanted to go to college. I was diagnosed with ADD in Highschool cause i knew my attention wasnâ€™t always there. I ended up doing great things my senior year in high school after being diagnosed my junior year. But I went for it and didnâ€™t let anything hold me back from accomplishing my dreams. I was nervous when I started and scared but i graduated with a 3.0. This is a memorable moment for me because I completed college on time within 4 years with a degree in Psychology and a Minor in Human Service and the accomplishments that Iâ€™ve done throughout college. I always wanted to help people and children. My goal is to go back and get my masterâ€™s in social work. But the will be a while from now. My dreams came true and I have the best support system anyone could ever ask for.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",
      "3 months ago, I finally graduated from college. I struggled in high school and didn't think i'd come this far. Everyone around me called me a class clown. They called me a low life loser. They said I'd go no where. The most hurtful point was when my parents gave up on me. I felt totally rejected and hurt. This gave me the tools to fight and keep going. I struggled through my reading and match. I begged for extra help. I struggled hard! I finally got through this and succeeded! I am so very proud of myself. I think I even make my parents proud of me. I'm ready for my next hurdle! With my talent, I can do it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",
      "I recently went with a close friend to her wedding dress alterations. We first met when we were in seventh grade art class together. We were twelve. Now we're in out twenties, college graduates and she's a mom. Getting to see her in her dress before the wedding, just the two of us, was a special moment. She looked beautiful and excited. She was nervous about the alterations and it was nice to be there for her. We had fun just spending time together, which we don't get to do as often as we used to. The most memorable moment was when I saw her in her dress for the first time. I'd gone wedding dress shopping with her, but I hadn't been with her when she found \"the one.\" She looked amazing! Like what you dream about looking like on your wedding day. I really enjoy getting to share these moments with her. We're part of a close-knit group of friends who have known each other since middle school. Looking back, it's crazy and amazing to see all the ways we've grown up together. I'm glad I get to be with her during this important life step. Going to the wedding dress alteration was a very memorable experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",
      "Over the past year I have been involved with a court situation involving my daughter and my granddaughter. Unfortunately she hasn't been able to care for her in the right way, due to mental health issues. This resulted  in my granddaughter's removal from my daughter's home. My granddaughter was placed in my temporary care for the past 12 months. I have tried over the last year to work on building a trusting relationship with my daughter and work with her to make sure she is seeing her daughter often. We have gone to family therapy and learned to communicate more effectively. There had been many times where this was painful to watch my daughter have emotions of loss and try to convince her that I had to look out for my granddaughter as well. As part of the court proposal they suggested I become guardian. My daughter was not willing to agree to this. This would mean there was a chance my granddaughter could be put into the foster system. We had court on May 7th the day before my 49th birthday.  I was sure my daughter would not agree to guardianship. When the lawyers went in front of the judge my daughter had agreed that she would allow me to have guardianship. This was emotional because I felt sad for my daughter that she knew she would not get her daughter back if had gone to trial. On the other hand I felt a great relief that my daughter trusts me enough that I will make sure she has as much time with her daughter to keep their relationship alive in the hopes that some day she will be able to have her back.                                                                                                                     1\n",
